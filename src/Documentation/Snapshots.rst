Snapshots
=========

When working with long-lived aggregates, performance when loading
aggregates, and thereby making changes to them, becomes a real concern.
Consider aggregates that are comprised of several thousands of events,
some of which needs to go through a rigorous
`update <./EventUpgrade.md>`__ process before they are applied to the
aggregates.

EventFlow supports aggregate snapshots, which is basically a capture of
the entire aggregate state every few events. So instead of loading the
entire aggregate event history, the latest snapshot is loaded, then
applied to the aggregate and then the remaining events that were not
captured in the snapshot.

To configure an aggregate root to support snapshots, inherit from
``SnapshotAggregateRoot<,,>`` and define a serializable snapshot type
that is marked with the ``ISnapshot`` interface.

.. code-block:: c#

    [SnapshotVersion("user", 1)]
    public class UserSnapshot : ISnapshot
    {
      ...
    }

    public class UserAggregate :
      SnapshotAggregateRoot<UserAggregate, UserId, UserSnapshot>
    {
      protected override Task<UserSnapshot> CreateSnapshotAsync(
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
      {
        // Create a UserSnapshot based on the current aggregate state
        ...
      }

      protected override Task LoadSnapshotAsync(
        UserSnapshot snapshot,
        ISnapshotMetadata metadata,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
      {
        // Load the UserSnapshot into the current aggregate
        ...
      }
    }

When using aggregate snapshots there are several important details to
remember

-  Aggregates must not make any assumptions regarding the existence of
   snapshots
-  Aggregates must not assume that snapshots are created with increasing
   aggregate sequence numbers
-  Snapshots must be created in such a way, that the represent the
   entire history up to the point of snapshot creation

Snapshot strategy
-----------------

When implementing an aggregate root that inherits from
``SnapshotAggregateRoot<,,>``, you need to pass the base class an
implementation of ``ISnapshotStrategy``. The strategy is used to
determine when a snapshot should be created, e.g. every 100 events.

EventFlow ships with two that should be enough for most purposes as they
can be configured.

-  ``SnapshotEveryFewVersionsStrategy:`` Snapshots are created after a
   predefined number of events, the default is ``100``, but another
   frequency can be specified
-  ``SnapshotRandomlyStrategy:`` Snapshots are created randomly with a
   predefined chance, the default is ``1%``, but another can be
   specified

Upgrading snapshots
-------------------

As an application grows over time, the data required to be stored within
a snapshots will change. Either because some become obsolete or merely
because a better way of storing the aggregate state is found. If this
happens, the snapshots persisted in the snapshot store could potentially
become useless as aggregates are unable to apply them. The easy solution
would be to make change-by-addition and make sure that the old snapshots
can be desterilized into the new version.

EventFlow provides an alternative solution, which is basically allowing
developers to upgrade snapshots similar to how `events are
upgraded <./EventUpgrade.md>`__.

Lets say we have an application that has developed three snapshots
versions over time.

.. code-block:: c#

    [SnapshotVersion("user", 1)]
    public class UserSnapshotV1 : ISnapshot
    {
      ...
    }

    [SnapshotVersion("user", 2)]
    public class UserSnapshotV2 : ISnapshot
    {
      ...
    }

    [SnapshotVersion("user", 3)]
    public class UserSnapshot : ISnapshot
    {
      ...
    }

Note how version three of the ``UserAggregate`` snapshot is called
``UserSnapshot`` and not ``UserSnapshotV3``, its basically to help
developers tell which snapshot version is the current one.

Remember to add the ``[SnapshotVersion]`` attribute as it enables
control of the snapshot definition name. If left out, EventFlow will
make a guess, which will be tied to the name of the class type.

The next step will be to implement upgraders, or mappers, that can
upgrade one snapshot to another.

.. code-block:: c#

    public class UserSnapshotV1ToV2Upgrader :
      ISnapshotUpgrader<UserSnapshotV1, UserSnapshotV2>
    {
        public Task<UserSnapshotV2> UpgradeAsync(
          UserSnapshotV1 userSnapshotV1,
          CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
          // Map from V1 to V2 and return
        }
    }

    public class UserSnapshotV2ToV3Upgrader :
      ISnapshotUpgrader<UserSnapshotV2, UserSnapshot>
    {
        public Task<UserSnapshot> UpgradeAsync(
          UserSnapshotV2 userSnapshotV2,
          CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
          // Map from V2 to V3 and return
        }
    }

The snapshot types and upgraders then only needs to be registered in
EventFlow.

.. code-block:: c#

    var resolver = EventFlowOptions.New
      ...
      .AddSnapshotUpgraders(myAssembly)
      .AddSnapshots(myAssembly)
      ...
      .CreateResolver();

Now, when ever a snapshot is loaded from the snapshot store, its
automatically upgraded to the latest version and the aggregate only
needs to concern itself with the latest version.

Snapshot store implementations
------------------------------

EventFlow has built-in support for some snapshot stores (more *will* be
implemented).

Null (or none)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default implementation used by EventFlow does absolutely nothing
besides logging a warning if used. It exist only to help developers to
select a proper snapshot store. Making in-memory the default
implementation could present problems if snapshots were configured, but
the snapshot store configuration forgotten.

In-memory
~~~~~~~~~

For testing, or small applications, the in-memory snapshot store is
configured by merely calling ``UseInMemorySnapshotStore()``.

.. code-block:: c#

    var resolver = EventFlowOptions.New
      ...
      .UseInMemorySnapshotStore()
      ...
      .CreateResolver();

Microsoft SQL Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use the MSSQL snapshot store you need to install the NuGet package
``EventFlow.MsSql``.

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configure the MSSQL connection and snapshot store as shown here.

.. code-block:: c#

    var rootResolver = EventFlowOptions.New
      ...
      .ConfigureMsSql(MsSqlConfiguration.New
        .SetConnectionString(@"Server=.\SQLEXPRESS;Database=MyApp;User Id=sa;Password=???"))
      .UseMsSqlSnapshotStore()
      ...
      .CreateResolver();

Note that if you already use MSSQL for event- or read model store, you
only need to invoke the ``ConfigureMsSql`` extension *once*.

Create and migrate required MSSQL databases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you can use the MSSQL snapshot store, the required database and
tables must be created. The database specified in your MSSQL connection
*will not* be automatically created, you have to do this yourself.

To make EventFlow create the required tables, execute the following
code.

.. code-block:: c#

    var msSqlDatabaseMigrator = rootResolver.Resolve<IMsSqlDatabaseMigrator>();
    EventFlowSnapshotStoresMsSql.MigrateDatabase(msSqlDatabaseMigrator);

You should do this either on application start or preferably upon
application install or update, e.g., when the web site is installed.

Custom
~~~~~~

If none of the above stores are adequate, a custom implementation is
possible by implementing the interface ``ISnapshotPersistence``.
However, there are some rules that the snapshot persistence store *must*
follow.

-  Its valid to store snapshots in any order, e.g. first version 3 then
   2
-  Its valid to overwrite existing snapshots version, e.g. storing
   version 3 then version 3 again
-  Fallback to old snapshots is allowed
