Event upgrade
=============

At some point you might find the need to replace a event with zero or
more events. Some use cases might be

-  A previous application version introduced a domain error in the form
   of a wrong event being emitted from the aggregate
-  Domain has changed, either from a change in requirements or simply
   from a better understanding of the domain

EventFlow event upgraders are invoked whenever the event stream is
loaded from the event store. Each event upgrader receives the entire
event stream one event at a time.

A new instance of a event upgrader is created each time an aggregate is
loaded. This enables you to store information from previous events on
the upgrader instance to be used later, e.g. to determine an action to
take on a event or provide additional information for a new event.

Note that the *ordering* of event upgraders is important as you might
implement two upgraders, one upgrade a event from V1 to V2 and then
another upgrading V2 to V3. EventFlow orders the event upgraders by name
before starting the event upgrade.

.. CAUTION::

    Be careful when working with event upgraders that return zero or more
    than one event, as this have an influence on the aggregate version and
    you need to make sure that the aggregate sequence number on upgraded
    events are valid in regard to the aggregate history.


Example - removing a damaged event
----------------------------------

To remove an event, simply check and only return the event if its no the
event you want to remove.

.. code-block:: c#

    public class DamagedEventRemover : IEventUpgrader<MyAggregate, MyId>
    {
      public IEnumerable<IDomainEvent<TestAggregate, TestId>> Upgrade(
        IDomainEvent<TestAggregate, TestId> domainEvent)
      {
        var damagedEvent = domainEvent as IDomainEvent<MyAggregate, MyId, DamagedEvent>;
        if (damagedEvent == null)
        {
          yield return domainEvent;
        }
      }
    }

Example - replace event
-----------------------

To one event to another, you should use the
``IDomainEventFactory.Upgrade`` to help migrate meta data and create the
new event.

.. code-block:: c#

    public class UpgradeMyEventV1ToMyEventV2 : IEventUpgrader<MyAggregate, MyId>
    {
      private readonly IDomainEventFactory _domainEventFactory;

      public UpgradeTestEventV1ToTestEventV2(IDomainEventFactory domainEventFactory)
      {
        _domainEventFactory = domainEventFactory;
      }

      public IEnumerable<IDomainEvent<TestAggregate, TestId>> Upgrade(
        IDomainEvent<TestAggregate, TestId> domainEvent)
      {
        var myEventV1 = domainEvent as IDomainEvent<MyAggregate, MyId, MyEventV1>;
        yield return myEventV1 == null
          ? domainEvent
          : _domainEventFactory.Upgrade<MyAggregate, MyId>(
            domainEvent, new MyEventV2());
      }
    }
