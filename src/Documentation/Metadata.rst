Metadata
========

Metadata is all the "additional" information that resides with a emitted
event, some of which is required information.

In EventFlow metadata is merely a ``IEnumerable`` of
``KeyValuePair<string,string>`` for which each is a metadata entry.

Out of the box these metadata keys are added to each aggregate event.

-  ``event_name`` and ``event_version`` - A name and version for the
   event which is used during event deserialization.
-  ``timestamp`` - A ``DateTimeOffset`` for when the event was emitted
   from the aggregate.
-  ``aggregate_sequence_number`` - The version the aggregate was after
   the event was emitted, e.g. ``1`` for the very first event emitted.


.. _metadata-providers-custom:

Custom metadata provider
------------------------

If you require additional information to be stored along with each
event, then you can implement the ``IMetadataProvider`` interface and
register the class using e.g. ``.AddMetadataProvider(...)`` on
``EventFlowOptions``.

Additional built-in providers
-----------------------------

EventFlow ships with a collection of ready-to-use providers in some of
its NuGet packages.

EventFlow
~~~~~~~~~

-  **AddEventTypeMetadataProvider**
-  ``event_type_assembly_name`` - Assembly name of the assembly
   containing the event
-  ``event_type_assembly_version`` - Assembly version of the assembly
   containing the event
-  ``event_type_fullname`` - Full name of the event corresponding to
   ``Type.FullName`` for the aggregate event type.
-  **AddGuidMetadataProvider**
-  ``guid`` - A new ``Guid`` for each event.
-  **AddMachineNameMetadataProvider**
-  ``environment_machinename`` - Adds the machine name handling the
   event from ``Environment.MachineName``

EventFlow.Owin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **AddRequestHeadersMetadataProvider**
-  ``request_header[HEADER]`` - Adds all headers from the OWIN request
   as metadata, each as a separate entry for which ``HEADER`` in the is
   replace with the name of the header. E.g. the
   ``request_header[Connection]`` might contain the value
   ``Keep-Alive``.
-  **AddUriMetadataProvider**
-  ``request_uri`` - OWIN request URI.
-  ``request_method`` - OWIN request method.
-  **AddUserHostAddressMetadataProvider**
-  ``user_host_address`` - The provider tries to find the correct user
   host address by inspecting request headers, i.e., if you have a load
   balancer in front of your application, then the request IP is not the
   real user address, but the load balancer should send the user IP as a
   header.
-  ``user_host_address_source_header`` - The header for of which the
   user host address was taken.
-  ``remote_ip_address`` - The remote IP address. Note that this might
   be the IP address of your load balancer.
